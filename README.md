  **What is OpenApi?**
<p>
  OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger Specification) is an API description format for REST APIs. An OpenAPI file allows you to describe your entire API, including:

  * Available endpoints (/users) and operations on each endpoint (GET /users, POST users)
  * Operation parameters Input and output for each operation
  * Authentication methods
  * Contact information, license, terms of use and other information.

API specifications can be written in YAML or JSON. The format is easy to learn and readable to both humans and machines. The complete OpenAPI Specification can be found on GitHub: OpenAPI 3.0 Specification
</p>

  **What is Swagger?**
<p>
Swagger provides a tool for presenting this documentation: Swagger UI. Swagger UI creates a web page from OpenAPI Specification definitions.

Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs. The major Swagger tools include:

* Swagger Editor – browser-based editor where you can write OpenAPI specs.
* Swagger UI – renders OpenAPI specs as interactive API documentation.
* Swagger Codegen – generates server stubs and client libraries from an OpenAPI spec.
